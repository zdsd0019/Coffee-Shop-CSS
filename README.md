# 1. Coffee Shop: Markup Language

You have been asked to develop a menu for the new Nitro Coffee Shop that has just opened up around the corner. The problem is the coffee shop isn't run by humans, it is owned and managed by machines. Your task is to develop a menu that both customers and machines can understand. Using the syntax and semantics for a markup language, create a menu that communicates the options available for customers to order. These options are organized into the following categories:

* Hot drinks
* Cold drinks
* Pastries

Using the list of available items below, structure your markup document to effectively communicate all information in a meaningful way.

### Hot Drinks
*  In-house Brew
  * Our in-house medium roast is a classic balance between sweet vanilla, nutty hazelnut, and a smooth low acidity to bring everything together.
  * $2.99
  
* Espresso
  - A balance between bold and smooth, powerful and sweet, our signature espresso blend is a complex flavor profile. It features strong notes of semi-sweet chocolate and caramel, with mild acidity and a bright floral finish.
  -  $4.99

### Cold Drinks
*  Cold Brew
  *  Our bright and delicious coffee blend, brewed over ice to give you a cold coffee freshness with all the flavor of our amazing in-house coffee.
  *  $3.99

* Iced Chai Latte
  * A creamy drink with a kick, this drink features spicy chai tea blended with your choice of milk and poured over ice.
  * $6.99

### Pastries
* Bacon Oatmeal Raisin Cookie

  * $3.50

* Blueberry, Lemon and Thyme Muffin
  * Tart and sweet, this classic blueberry and lemon combination comes with an earthy twist.
  * $2.50


# 2. Coffee Shop: Menu HTML Structure

Now that the owners of Nitro Coffee understand what is on their menu through the use of a markup language, it is time to post their menu on the internet. The problem is web browsers don't understand the current markup language you have designed for the coffee shop.

Your task is to convert your markup menu into the markup language of the web, HTML. Beyond the basic HTML boilerplate, your menu should include the following:

*  A level one headingA navigation bar
  * use an unordered list for your navigation links
  * each navigation link should use an anchor tag
  
* Use a level two heading to define each section of the menu
* Each item should have the following:
  * A level three heading for the name of the item
  * Use a paragraph tag to display the description and price

Be sure to properly use semantic tags. If you recall, some semantic tags include:

* header
* nav
* main
* section
* footer
 
#### Note: Do not style your HTML document, simply build the structure. 

# 3. Coffee Shop: Landing Page HTML Structure

Now that you have a menu created from the previous exercise, it is now time to notify the public that Nitro Coffee is open for business. To create some online presence for the shop, develop a website that will consist of a single a landing page.
